Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The system DriverPass was intended to create was to be a platform for customers to book private driving lessons, helping them prepare to pass the DMV test for their driver's license. The client aimed for a user-friendly interface that would allow users to easily schedule lessons, make payments, and manage their reservations. The design focused on providing a seamless experience, ensuring that customers could access all necessary features quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the system needed to comply with DMV regulations and maintain secure data handling for user information and transactions. Overall, DriverPass was designed to support learners in achieving their driving goals while enhancing their confidence on the road.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did well with the written portions of the assignment, effectively conveying my ideas and meeting the project's requirements. I have confidence in my writing skills, and I am pleased with how I communicated the system design and user needs clearly and concisely. My ability to express my thoughts ensures that the reader understands the project’s objectives and design principles.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably redo the diagrams since I initially struggled with Lucidchart. Although I eventually became more familiar with the tool, I found it challenging to use at times. If I could go back, I would spend more time learning the platform—perhaps by utilizing a free trial—to improve my skills before creating the diagrams. This would allow me to produce clearer, more polished visuals rather than relying on hand-drawn versions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I was able to interpret the user's needs by going through the transcript of the conversation and indentifying exactly what the client did, and didn't want, and what exactly would work and what wouldn't for them. This helped me design a system that aligns with their goals, incorporating essential features like easy booking and payment options.

Considering the user's needs is vital in design because it ensures the final product is user-friendly and meets the expectations of its target audience. This leads to higher satisfaction and better usability, ultimately contributing to the project's success

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I personally approach designing software systematically, following a step-by-step process to ensure all aspects are thoroughly considered. This includes gathering requirements, creating diagrams, and drafting a design that ultimately meets user needs. In the future, I would utilize techniques such as having more user interviews for deeper insights and more prototyping/sketching to visualize diagrams.
